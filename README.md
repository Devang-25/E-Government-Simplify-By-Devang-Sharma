# BackGround

Digitization initiatives have a good intention to simplify the process and to save time for Employees and Citizens. However, sometimes it does backfire due to lack of homework and lack of thoughts on Business Process Optimization. Many times adoption of such digital initiatives is low due to lower quality of user experience and broken business process flow compared to the reality on the ground.

# What Is Business Process Framework

The Business Process Framework (eTOM) is a critical component of the Open Digital Framework, TM Forum’s blueprint for enabling successful business transformation.<br>
It is a comprehensive, industry-agreed, multi-layered view of the key business processes required to run an efficient, effective and agile digital enterprise.
<br>
All of the Open Digital Framework, including the Business Process Framework, is created and evolved by industry leaders and practitioners in TM Forum’s member driven collaboration community.
